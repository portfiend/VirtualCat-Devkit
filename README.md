# Virtual Cat Avatar Developer Kit

This is a devkit for the Second Life "Virtual Cat" avatar. Feel free to use this devkit to make texture kits and and mod parts.

If you plan on making mods or derivative avatars, I ask you to not try to use it to turn a significant profit. I am giving this avatar and devkit out For Free. The spirit of the avatar is being cheap and modifiable and accessible as possible.

Virtual Cat is made in affiliation with SCRIMBLO WORLD, a store collective for those who enjoy unusual, cute, cartoony, and weird avatars. The stuff we make aims to be cheap and modifiable. In the future we may put together a website, but for now, here is where you can find us:

If you like the design of Virtual Cat, I highly recommend checking Scrimblo World out for similar stuff.
